## Constraints

#### Obligatory part

 * Passengers need to travel from specific airport to specific airport using a flight that starts not earlier than their intended flight. (`flights.csv`)
 * For every crew member its next flight have to start from the same airport as previous one ended. It might be possible for a crew to travel as passanger, but then they are payed according to deadheading rate.
 * When airport is closed the planes are not allowed to land of takeoff (`airport_closures.csv`)
 * Member of the crew can not work (what it means?) when are unavailable (`crew_unavailabilities.csv`)
 * Aircraft can not be in use (what it means?) when it was disrupted (`aircraft_disruption`)
 * When flight is disrupted its flight duration is longer by delta (`flight_disruptions.csv`)
 * Aircraft have to be in one of specified airports for maintence in the scheduled time. So the flight before (how much before?) it's maintenace needs to land in the correct airport. Additionaly the next flight's take-off needs to be after(how much after?) the maintence is finished (`maintenance.csv`)
 

* **Are there any constraints from** `crew_rosterings.csv` **?????** --> In `crew_rosterings.csv` there is information about cost of deadheading, but in whole data base there is no information about if specific flight is deadhead for specific pilot. However, in "crew.csv' there is info about rest time so we should implement constraint that specific pilot cannot work without resting and cannot work more than a specified amouont of time
* In a given time a given aircraft can not fly ('aircraft_unavailabilities.csv')
* Specific pilot can work maximum given amount of time ('min_pilots.csv')
* Specific pilots should only work at specific type of aircraft ('crew_pairings.csv', 'crew.csv')
* We cannot deadhead the group to be a crew in a flight if they don't have enough working time specific day ('crew_groups.csv') (?)
	
*TODO: if you know pnr, you can know also passenger_id of all passengers assigned to pnr? does the ticket_id have the same information as pnr?
*TODO: does the type of a flight (D/C/I) make matter about anything like maximum work time?

### Additional part

 * On some airport the aircraft is not allowed to land or takeoff (`aircraft_restriction.csv`)
 * Aircraft can not carry too many people and we prefer to not change the seating class of passengers (`cabin_capacities.csv`)
 * Landing and takeoff can only happen during service hours of the airport (`airports.csv`)
 * Landing and takeoff can 
 * Time between landing and takeoff can not be too short (`min_ground_time.csv`)
 * There are some(?) contraints for crew working time??? (`crew_rostering.csv`, `flights.csv`, `crew.csv`, `crew_groups.csv`, `crew_pairings.csv`)
 * The number of non-pilot crew for a flight on a specific aircraft family for a given number of passangers can not be too small. For example (`min_cabin_crew.csv`)
 * For a given flight duration the number of pilots can not be too small (`min_pilots.csv`)
 * The time between landing and takeoff of a given passanger when changing flights can not be too small (`min_con_pax.csv`)
 * **Some constraints about slots and working time of the crew** `slot_changes.csv`, `slot.csv`, `visa.csv`, `crew_groups.csv`
 * 
 * 
 
 
 ## Costs to minimize
* If a delay is greater than 5 hours, airline must provide a hotel accomodation for each delayed flight passenger - it depends on airport, what is the unit cost (cost per passenger) for the hotel ('airports.csv') (?)
* Cost per minute of deadheading (moving the team who can carry the specifit flight to another airport) the group ('crew_groups.csv')


○ hotel_cost: Average cost of hotel accommodation.
○ cppax_takeoff: Cost per passenger for takeoff.
○ cpT_landing: Cost per ton for landing.
○ cpTpd_landing: Cost per ton per day for landing.
○ cpm_deadhead: Cost per minute of deadheading the group.
○ cpm_reserve: Cost per minute while operating as a reserve crew.
○ value: Meal cost per passenger.

*TODO - SUGGESTION: It would be probably better not to optimize the specific costs like ccpax_takeoff, it would be better to optimize weighted sum of this costs
